## Summary
Automatically send personalized replies to selcted email messages

## General
This program will send automated replies, with attachments. I developed this initially automate replying to job recruiters. I wanted to send a standardized reply to each recruiter, but personalized with their name. I also wanted to attach a pdf with my latest resume. gMail filters, rules, and drafts could not fill my requirements. This program is still in the rough stages, most certianly pre-release. But it is functional. Program defaults are set in the 'settings.gs' file. These include required labels and document files.
## Setup
1. Clone the repository into a directory on you local workstation, or download the Zip file and unzip it.
2. Create a new Google Scripts project. Copy all of the included files into the Goolge Script project.

The interface is still rough. You run utilixe the program by clicking on the 'Run' button in the Googel Scripts IDE.
